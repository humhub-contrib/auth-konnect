# Kopano Connect Sign-In

Using this module, users can directly log in or register with their Kopano credentials at this HumHub installation. 
A new button "Kopano" will appear on the login page.

## Configuration

Please follow the [Kopano instructions](https://documentation.kopano.io/user_manual_webapp//settings.html) to create the required ` OpenIDConnect` credentials.

Once you have the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** created there, the values must then be entered in the module configuration at: `Administration -> Modules -> Konnect Auth -> Settings`. 
This page also displays the `Authorized redirect URI`, which must be inserted in Konnect in the corresponding field.
